      <h3>
	Introduction:
      </h3>
      <p>
	Bias is, for our purposes, prejudice in favor or against a thing without proper justification or rationale behind it. The ideal for decision making is almost always to make the most advantageous decision without biases, but the much more achievable goal when making decisions is to keep your personal biases in mind while deciding what to do.
      </p>
      <h3>
	The IKEA effect
      </h3>
      <p>
	I think this is the most dangerous bias that will affect our ISP. The IKEA effect is when we excessively prioritize or place higher value on the things that we make or the jobs that we are a part of (The Decision Lab). Basically, we tend to prize things that are highly important to us personally, although it might not be exactly worth-while. I think that it will influence our ISP the most because personally the do-it-yourself mentality that a project like this cultivates makes ineffective ideas, such as creating my own ESC, plausible. The best way to overcome this effect is to slow down my mental process while developing, and truly questioning why I am choosing the methods or tools that I am choosing.
      </p>
      <h3>
	Availability Heuristic
      </h3>
      <p>
	A heuristic is a type of bias that can more accurately be thought of as a sort of “mental shortcut” that humans make based on prior experience (SimplyPsychology). The availability heuristic is when we overvalue or overestimate the first idea that we have in our head. Of course this is faulty because it leads us to skip over important aspects of the planning process but also causes us to miss on other equally as or more valid solutions. To uproot this heuristic, I plan to talk things over before making a decision, someone else's first idea will be different to yours and having a variety of perspectives will allow us to circumvent this bias.
      </p>
      <h3>
	Sunk Cost Bias
      </h3>
      <p>
	More commonly known as the sunk-cost fallacy. The sunk cost bias is when one continues a behavior or project as a result of previously invested resources (behavioraleconomics.com). This is a product of not wanting to waste on prior investment, and is related to loss aversive behavior. With any large project the sunk cost bias is present, especially if a large amount of time and money was spent trying to make something work. Of course this is not always unreasonable, as continued investment might prove fruitful. To circumvent this bias, as with most biases, you have to take a step back and really inspect if what you are doing is worthwhile to any capacity.
      </p>
      <h3>
	Anchoring Bias
      </h3>
      <p>
	Also known as “first impression bias,” this bias relates to human tendency to use the first piece of information that we are given and solely use that for our conclusions. Once our opinion is formed from that, it becomes more difficult to change course or consider other options (Timely). This is similar to the next bias, but affects our ISP in a different way. The information that I learned earlier in my research made it harder to change the scope of the project, I had to, and will have to, overcome this bias by tracing my decision and considering why exactly I want to do what I want to.
      </p>
      <h3>
	The Framing Effect
      </h3>
      <p>
	The last bias that I think would impact the development of our ISP the most is the framing effect. First observed by Tversky and Khanehmen in 1974 (Sunstein & Thaler). The framing effect dictates that the decision between risk averse and risk seeking is affected by the working or framing of the choice. Basically, the more negatively worded the risk is, the less likely we are to choose (e.g. “20% chance of gain” will be chosen more often than “80% chance of loss”). This affects our isp because when we think, internally, of some decisions, the way we frame them in our mind heavily affects what we choose.
