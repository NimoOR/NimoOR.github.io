      <p>Fast, quiet, efficient, and graceful, the cat aims to be the premium cafe racer for the city. The electric motor saves on weight and size, creating a slim and maneuverable bike for squeezing through alleyways and traffic, while still competing with its combustion engine counterpart for top speed and acceleration. Where there is no competition, however, is the engine’s efficiency, with lower operating and maintenance costs across the board. A cat has nine lives, and not a single one lost with the cat’s custom PID acceleration and controlled deceleration loop, and assisted cruise control. Disappear into the night with the cat’s black matte finish and red highlights. The cat is for the businessmen, the students, the billionaires, the vigilantes and burglers looking for slick, under-the-radar electric experience

      <p>In this project, this team aims to prove that any old motorcycle could be renewed into a functional and graceful piece of utility. We aim to take a broken down and decrepit old cat and turn it into a competitive option for transportation. We are competing with larger companies, but we aim to achieve our goals at a fraction of the cost. In terms of expenses, the project will requre investments made into motors and batteries mostly, with the obvious purchase of the motorcycle chasis. For marketing, we plan to use our exorbetent amount of money to sponsor others to get our name out. The team will include the firmware designer, the auxiliary designer, responsible for software other than the firmware, such as the speedometer, the mechanical lead, which will install the motor and gearbox, and the auxiliary physical lead, which will handle all other aspects of the bike, such as the wheels or handlebars.</p>
