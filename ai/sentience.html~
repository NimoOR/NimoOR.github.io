	AI Sentience and Its Consequences
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Before one can proper evaluate the possible consequances of a sentient AI, one must first consider the meaning of sentience. I argue that first and foremost, sentience, or possing sentience, is the ability to create Qualia. Qualia, as defined by philosophy of the mind, are singular subjective experiences that are functionally irreplicable, in common parlance you might refer to it as "lived experience". There are many doubts on whether this can even apply for AI, after all, AI can never truly be subjective, the experience is produced by sechmatics and all data is repplicable. However, if one supercedes those worried than the question becomes what might occur after an object recieves sentience? what are the consequences?
    </p>
    <p>
      As defined prior, sentience involves the subjective experience of the object, and if AI acheives subjective experience, it creates an ego. The center of subjective experience is the self, or ego. If an AI creates an ego it can percieve the world in terms of itself and others, as opposed to percieving the world in numbers. To compare this to our own, human, condition, although we percieve the world in light refractions and sounds, we exist in terms of me, you, us, them. This thinking is what allows humans to think of themselves, of their own best interest, it is what creates individual personalities, and those experiences are also what makes life valuable. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of, for example, murder. Why is it wrong? Murder is essentially wrong because one is violating anothers qualia. We stop others from murdering because we want to protect the qualia of others. When AI achieves sentience, should we be inclined to protect it's lived experience as well? Morally, sentient AI is horrific.
